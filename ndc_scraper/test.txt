__label__microservices __label__security __label__architecture	Microservices are all the rage, and so are security breaches! Learn what you can do to create one without the other.  Microservices give us many options. We can pick different technologies, mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns. But they also give us different options for how we think about securing our systems. Done right, and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes. Done wrong, and you can increase the surface area of attack. This talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth, discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine-grained, distributed architectures. Developers, architects, technical leaders, operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components. The audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about AppSec, and also understand how microservices can help (or hinder) building a secure system.

We will discuss ways to integrate your existing software or database into an Alexa Skill, allowing for voice-activated, meaningful interaction with a user.  Using this SAAS approach, with Web API hosted on Azure can make this process easy for rapid prototyping. We will build and deploy a skill that you can use immediately with your Alexa enabled device, and discuss the challenges of the publishing journey to get in Alexa's Skill Store.
__label__javascript __label__mobile	React Native allows developers to create native cross-platform using JavaScript, or really anything that will compile to JS C#, TypeScript, or even F#. But why would you use React Native? How run-time typed language like JavaScript be a better choice for developing apps than say, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C# ( Xamarin ) or C++ all compile time static type checked languages. Firstly is just that, there is no need for a compile step, React Native can update the JS without having to reload compile and replace the previous application. Compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1-5min, but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app.  In this talk, we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles, how you can use tools like Flow or TypeScript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods. To Prove the how simple and fast React Native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage. To top it all off, you can even embed React into existing Native Apps, avoiding the need for a total rewrite.
__label__design __label__ux __label__web __label__ui __label__mobile	Designing web apps is now more challenging than ever. With their potential ability to behave like native apps, PWAs have a more intimate user experience, they’re more responsive and much more powerful.  In this talk, you will learn the characteristics of PWAs from a design perspective, and guidelines for designing great PWAs. We will cover topics like app shell, touch guidelines, responsiveness, offline experiences & more.

__label__devops __label__cloud	Many “born in the cloud” organizations started and continue with “production only” deployments. This works fine in the early stages, but leads to complications later when a more robust set of processes must be put in place. In this session you’ll learn how to transform your “born in the cloud” Azure environment to one which has a proper development and production environment, how to ensure that your workloads are backed up and recoverable, and how to ensure that permissions and roles are configured so that coworkers have the rights that they need, rather than everyone sharing a single administrative account.
__label__net __label__mobile	Making apps for people with a disability with Xamarin tells you about making apps for people with an intellectual disability. Former, people thought people with an intellectual disability cannot read, thus a smartphone isn’t really realistic for them. But nonprofits and startups started to explore this userbase and found out a way of apps people with an intellectual disability can use.  Why is this important? Well there are two big reasons: first of all: If people with an intellectual disability can use your app, they can get info about their life-situation and that empowers quality of life. Smartphones by example uses Text-To-Speech and principal the need to “can read” isn’t there anymore. For you as developer or startup there’s also a big benefit of apps for these people: nearly every market is discovered for mobile apps. Every market has big concurrency. But the market of apps for people with a disability is quite less discovered, so if you are good, you can rule a hole market!
__label__net	I found a way to sidestep the CAP theorem, and in this session, I'll show you how to do it. No, seriously :) The CAP theorem is a very difficult problem to solve in distributed systems, but it turns out that there are a few simple rules that you can follow to get strong eventual consistency in the cloud. In this talk, I'll be doing the code samples in C#, as well as talk about the rules to make it all happen. At Domain.com.au in Australia, we used these principles to recover from catastrophic data failures in our clickstream events, and in this session, I'll show you how we did it. With CRDTs + Event Sourcing + immutability, there's a mathematically provable way to ensure that all nodes in a distributed system (such as a data store, or an Akka.NET grid) get the same level of consistency without even talking to each other. It's not magic--it's just good maths. Join me, and you'll be surprised at just how easy it is.
__label__net	Collecting measurements and log events from your applications is not enough. Whether you need to tame unruly legacy code, get the jump on production errors from your web app, or just survive operating a large microservices architecture, it's important to record the right data in a format you can use efficiently when it counts. This session will explore Serilog, a deceptively simple twist on application logging that's changed the way .NET applications are instrumented. You'll learn how to track complex application behavior through distributed and asynchronous systems, without sacrificing any of the development-time productivity of simple text logging. Instrumentation is a critical part of application development that's too-often overlooked. For a small investment up-front, you can save a great deal of time (and stress) in production. Your future self will thank you for it!
__label__javascript	React is a JavaScript library for creating high-performing, maintainable JavaScript applications and brings a fresh approach to thinking into the JavaScript community. Being a declarative user interface library that is un-opinionated about the rest of your application it is easy to reason about it is simpler to learn and master the basics than a full application framework like Angular. Also thanks to the simple nature of React, the patterns and lessons you will learn are transferable to other libraries and frameworks. Jake found out about React about two years ago, loved it and has since been moving towards using it full time. He has helped build finance applications in London, customer facing portals, done many presentations and now works with React full time at Seven West Media building thewest.com.au and many other projects.   This workshop is for you if you: Participants need to bring a laptop with the following installed:

In this session Barry will take you beyond SQL injection covering some of the code behind now fixed ASP.NET vulnerabilities. By the end of the session you should be poring through your own code looking for problems with dictionaries, compression, encryption and more.
	How is natural & intuitive interactive functionality & usability designed into the latest and greatest emerging experiences? Join Tim Huckaby in a discussion & demonstration of the lessons learned in ~10 years of putting high profile interactive software systems into production for customers like CNN, Microsoft, Nike and many others. All the bad; all the good; the cutting edge and the tools, tips and tricks learned along the way that will help you in designing great natural interactive usability into your own software.  Technology has evolved to the point that the software and systems which have become necessary parts of our daily lives need to know more about us in order to help us in smarter ways. The environment that encapsulates the digital experience is just as important as the software. The entirety is the experience. The user shouldn’t feel the technology in the experience. Emerging Experiences should extend real world metaphors into software so that it blends together seamlessly. Emerging Experiences demand good Interaction Design. This demo focused session will take an impressive look at some of the best software being built today and into the immediate future that leverages the Emerging Experiences.
	In this 2-day workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of building cross-platform mobile apps targeting iOS and Android devices using React Native. React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript, without the need to use languages like Objective-C, Swift, or Java.  Although you write JavaScript with React Native, the components you define will end up rendering as native widgets on the respective platforms. Hence, React Native allows you to write truly native applications, with the ease and speed of development and debugging using JavaScript.

__label__security __label__people	Are you responsible for more than just AppSec? What do you do when you have more teams to support than security experts? How can you make security champions out of dissenters in the development team? There just aren’t enough security experts to go around. You have to support the multitude of Agile and DevOps teams that are making production software changes anywhere from once a month to several times a day? The lack of resources coupled with the ever increasing responsibilities can make you feel like a rouge warrior in the battle against cybercrime. What’s a security professional to do? Whether you are a team of one or five, there aren’t enough hours in the day and even if there was more budget, good luck finding someone to fill that security role. What if I told you that through careful selection and good training it is possible to build your own army from the very people who own the development process? What you will learn: 1. Who to recruit as security champions 2. How to train these champions in productive application security 3. How to measure success 4. How to build a scalable security program 5. What to expect from champions (responsibilities)
__label__languages	Treating behaviors first-class entities is a staple of functional programming. As “The Command Pattern,” it is a staple of OOP as well. In this talk, we will take a look at this classic pattern, and then we'll see how it can be applied to modern problems like concurrency, serializability, and separation of concerns.
	Kotlin is a programming language developed by JetBrains that targets multiple platforms including the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native support in the works. The language provides object oriented as well as functional constructs and has been adopted by Google as an official language for Android Development, and being used by many well-known companies such as Gradle, Netflix, Basecamp, BBC, Pinterst and many others.  This full-day workshop will focus on teaching you Kotlin from the very basics. This workshop is aimed at those that are not familiar with Kotlin and want to get up to speed with the language, independently of whether they have some previous experience of working with the JVM. An IDE or editor, Kotlin Compiler or Plugin and a version of the JDK installed. Any Operating System is fine.

__label__microsoft __label__net __label__testing	It’s fair to say that most software developers value very highly the productivity boost that comes with being able to work in a development environment that provides a real-time feedback loop. Historically, C# has been far from that - as typically developers had to rebuild their projects after every change, and the process of finding issues in the code has always felt extremely heavy. Roslyn compiler and latest Visual Studio introduced a lot exciting tools, improvements and APIs that help in this area. In this talk, we will look at various techniques to leverage these interactive capabilities. We’ll look at the REPL and Interactive Window, scripting APIs, live Roslyn analyzers, a much improved Edit-and-Continue support and interactive testing, all of which will hopefully help your development workflow be much more productive.
__label__security __label__web	Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.  Hack Yourself First” is all about building up defensive skills in developers. It looks at security from the attacker’s perspective and takes them through the steps necessary to exploit vulnerable software on the web so that they can experience hacking first hand. Workshop participants are set specific goals they must complete that involve probing for risks and then exploiting discrete vulnerabilities in a specially built vulnerable application. The interactive nature of the workshop means that multiple attack vectors are usually identified across the spectrum of participants and each person contributes their own unique perspective as to how specific risks are exploited. The objective of the workshop is that each person walks away with demonstrated experience across a broad spectrum of specific risks. They not only learn about but also demonstrate practical experience across a range of different vulnerabilities targeted to the specific needs of the group. Any software developer who wants to get a better understanding what is going on in cyber space if it comes to hacking and cracking of systems. This workshop enables you to take a pro-active approach and you learn how hackers will try to break your system. This workshop will be an eye opener for most developers and it is the starting point of becoming a better developer. It all starts with awareness and improving your own habits. So start hacking yourself first, to become a better developer! Attendees will need to bring a computer with the following software installed.

__label__continuousdelivery __label__microservices __label__agile	Feature flags are a valuable DevOps technique to deliver better, more reliable software faster. Feature flags can be used for both release management (dark launches, canary rollouts, betas) as well as long term control (entitlement management, user segmentation personalization). However, if not managed properly, feature flags can be very destructive technical debt. Feature flags need to be managed properly with visibility and control to both engineering and business users.
__label__agile	When you release your software and products into the world, you open yourself up to the gamut of possibilities. This includes negative feedback from customers that can leave even the most experienced developer unprepared.  This is something that applies to every developer and unfortunately usually doesn’t get addressed until it is too late, causing entire product pivots for non-issues. How can you stay on track when everything you hear tells you you’re wrong? Provide developers with a framework for filtering customer requests while still keeping them engaged Provide teams with a perspective on how to understand their customer 
__label__debugging __label__c __label__devops __label__net	The road to zen winds through self-monitoring and self-healing applications, which can reduce the time and effort in diagnosing and correcting production issues. In this talk, we will see how modern Windows applications (in .NET or C++) can self-monitor, self-diagnose, and potentially self-recover without needing an external monitoring agent or a brute-force restarting watchdog. By harnessing the power of ETW for low-level accurate monitoring, Windows performance counters for zero-overhead statistics, and the CLRMD library for inspecting your own threads, heap objects, and locks, you can take your applications one step closer to self-awareness. This will be illustrated through a series of demos: automatic CPU profiling and pinpointing the busy threads and stacks; automatic GC monitoring, including object allocations; automatic heap analysis to reveal unraveling memory leaks; and more. At the end of the talk, you will be equipped with tools and techniques for implementing self-monitoring in your own applications.

They integrate with TeamCity and indicate when a build is running and success/failure of all the tests. In this session, we will reverse engineer a bluetooth light bulb’s protocol, learn how to have an Intel Edison communicate with the bulb, and by the end you too will know how to make your own build lights! Please note that this talk will be highly technical. We will be discussing low level details of bluetooth communication, protocol analysis with Wireshark, sniffing bluetooth packets, etc.
__label__net	C# is a language of breadth. At one end it allows low-level programming with pointers and lock-free synchronization; at the other end, it sports high-level features such as closures, expressions trees and asynchronous functions. Which leads us to a challenge: can we write a non-contrived program that uses all of the above? The answer is "of course!", and I'm going to walk you through a practical example: a high-speed communications library built on shared memory (and used in production!) Come and join the author of C# 7 in a Nutshell and LINQPad in an advanced session, where we step outside the box and play with all of C#'s best toys at once.
__label__debugging __label__devops __label__javascript	Node runs on a powerful JavaScript engine, but that same engine can complicate things when it comes to obtaining accurate information on your application's performance.  There are plenty of tools for profiling C++ or Java applications, but understanding JavaScript interactions with native code can be extremely challenging. In this talk we will discuss profiling options for Node.js, including perf_events, dtrace, the V8's engine built-in --prof switch, and tools based on the bleeding-edge kernel BPF technology. We will also talk about turning profiler results into flame graphs, an innovative visualization tool for understanding stack sample reports, and for figuring out the time split across the JavaScript and native parts of your application.
__label__microsoft __label__cloud __label__database	Big data is the new big thing where storing the data is the easy part. Gaining insights in your pile of data is something different. Based on a data dump of the well-known StackExchange websites, we will store & analyse 150+ GB of data with Azure Data Lake Store & Analytics to gain some insights about their users. After that we will use Power BI to give an at a glance overview of our learnings. If you are a developer that is interested in big data, this is your time to shine! We will use our existing SQL & C# skills to analyse everything without having to worry about running clusters.
