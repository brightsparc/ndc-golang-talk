__label__architecture __label__database	multi tenant database architecture is a common and intuitive strategy for supporting many clients in the enterprise software world everyone s using the same software everyone s data fit the same schema and it s much easier to manage one database than dozens or hundreds but implicit in this is the assumption that each client is using the same of the same software and schema which is either fixed forever or under the vendor s complete control when this assumption no longer holds how can we accommodate a client who wants to strike out on their own without making export management a recurring chore for backend developers  relational databases provide the raw information we need by exposing the schema itself to the query engine but structuring and navigating it is up to us this talk explores building a future proof exporter with node js using metadata to graph a postgresql database s relationship structure isolate a single tenant s data and generate constraint safe scripts 
__label__security __label__dotnet	not encrypting your data is a risky move and just relying on hope that you won t get hacked and compromised is not a strategy  as a software developer you have a duty to your employer to secure and protect their data in this talk you will learn how to use the dotnet framework to protect your data to satisfy confidentiality integrity non repudiation and authentication this talk covers random number generation hashing authenticated hashing and password based key derivation functions the talk also covers both symmetric and asymmetric encryption using des triple des aes and rsa you then learn how to combine these all together to product a hybrid encryption scheme which includes aes rsa hmacs and digital signatures 
__label__cpp	cpp is a powerful language when used by a seasoned developer it is being used everywhere from operating systems and compilers to cross platform mobile apps development  but this power comes with a cost cpp programming is not simple nor easy with memory leaks stack overflows and strange exceptions a software developer needs all of the power he can use by harnessing the power of unit tests a software developer can find defects quickly avoid regression and speed up development time in this talk i ll show how to use the right unit testing tools and practices available that will help you get your cpp code under control and even test legacy code which no one ever want to touch

__label__cpp	cpp11 gave us lambdas in the language for the first time if you ignore boost lambda so it s a functional language now right there s a bit more to functional programming than having first class function objects i d even argue we still don t quite have that but does that mean we can t do functional programming in cpp yes no maybe  first we have to define what functional programming actually is and it may not be quite what you think then we need to see what valuable ideas have come out of the functional approach to software design and which ones we can use in cpp to good effect in the end we ll see that while not strictly a functional programming language we can get quite a long way with immutable data types persistent data structures atomic references and if you re not watching carefully we might even throw the m word in there all this based on real world experience not just theoretical
