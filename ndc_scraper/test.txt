__label__microservices __label__security __label__architecture	microservices are all the rage and so are security breaches learn what you can do to create one without the other  microservices give us many options we can pick different technologies mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns but they also give us different options for how we think about securing our systems done right and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes done wrong and you can increase the surface area of attack this talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine grained distributed architectures developers architects technical leaders operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components the audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about appsec and also understand how microservices can help or hinder building a secure system

__label__javascript __label__mobile	react native allows developers to create native cross platform using javascript or really anything that will compile to js c typescript or even f but why would you use react native how run time typed language like javascript be a better choice for developing apps than say swift java kotlin c xamarin or c all compile time static type checked languages firstly is just that there is no need for a compile step react native can update the js without having to reload compile and replace the previous application compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1 5min but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app  in this talk we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles how you can use tools like flow or typescript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods to prove the how simple and fast react native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage to top it all off you can even embed react into existing native apps avoiding the need for a total rewrite

__label__devops __label__cloud	many born in the cloud organizations started and continue with production only deployments this works fine in the early stages but leads to complications later when a more robust set of processes must be put in place  in this session you ll learn how to transform your born in the cloud azure environment to one which has a proper development and production environment how to ensure that your workloads are backed up and recoverable and how to ensure that permissions and roles are configured so that coworkers have the rights that they need rather than everyone sharing a single administrative account 
__label__ net __label__mobile	making apps for people with a disability with xamarin tells you about making apps for people with an intellectual disability former people thought people with an intellectual disability cannot read thus a smartphone isn t really realistic for them but nonprofits and startups started to explore this userbase and found out a way of apps people with an intellectual disability can use  why is this important well there are two big reasons first of all if people with an intellectual disability can use your app they can get info about their life situation and that empowers quality of life smartphones by example uses text to speech and principal the need to can read isn t there anymore for you as developer or startup there s also a big benefit of apps for these people nearly every market is discovered for mobile apps every market has big concurrency but the market of apps for people with a disability is quite less discovered so if you are good you can rule a hole market 
__label__ net	i found a way to sidestep the cap theorem and in this session i ll show you how to do it no seriously the cap theorem is a very difficult problem to solve in distributed systems but it turns out that there are a few simple rules that you can follow to get strong eventual consistency in the cloud  in this talk i ll be doing the code samples in c as well as talk about the rules to make it all happen at domain com au in australia we used these principles to recover from catastrophic data failures in our clickstream events and in this session i ll show you how we did it with crdts event sourcing immutability there s a mathematically provable way to ensure that all nodes in a distributed system such as a data store or an akka net grid get the same level of consistency without even talking to each other it s not magic it s just good maths join me and you ll be surprised at just how easy it is 
__label__ net	collecting measurements and log events from your applications is not enough whether you need to tame unruly legacy code get the jump on production errors from your web app or just survive operating a large microservices architecture it s important to record the right data in a format you can use efficiently when it counts  this session will explore serilog a deceptively simple twist on application logging that s changed the way net applications are instrumented you ll learn how to track complex application behavior through distributed and asynchronous systems without sacrificing any of the development time productivity of simple text logging instrumentation is a critical part of application development that s too often overlooked for a small investment up front you can save a great deal of time and stress in production your future self will thank you for it 
__label__javascript	react is a javascript library for creating high performing maintainable javascript applications and brings a fresh approach to thinking into the javascript community being a declarative user interface library that is un opinionated about the rest of your application it is easy to reason about it is simpler to learn and master the basics than a full application framework like angular also thanks to the simple nature of react the patterns and lessons you will learn are transferable to other libraries and frameworks jake found out about react about two years ago loved it and has since been moving towards using it full time he has helped build finance applications in london customer facing portals done many presentations and now works with react full time at seven west media building thewest com au and many other projects   this workshop is for you if you participants need to bring a laptop with the following installed

__label__security __label__people	are you responsible for more than just appsec what do you do when you have more teams to support than security experts how can you make security champions out of dissenters in the development team  there just aren t enough security experts to go around you have to support the multitude of agile and devops teams that are making production software changes anywhere from once a month to several times a day the lack of resources coupled with the ever increasing responsibilities can make you feel like a rouge warrior in the battle against cybercrime what s a security professional to do whether you are a team of one or five there aren t enough hours in the day and even if there was more budget good luck finding someone to fill that security role what if i told you that through careful selection and good training it is possible to build your own army from the very people who own the development process what you will learn 1 who to recruit as security champions 2 how to train these champions in productive application security 3 how to measure success 4 how to build a scalable security program 5 what to expect from champions responsibilities
