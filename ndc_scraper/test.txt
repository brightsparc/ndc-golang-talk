__label__javascript __label__mobile	react native allows developers to create native cross platform using javascript or really anything that will compile to js c typescript or even f but why would you use react native how run time typed language like javascript be a better choice for developing apps than say swift java kotlin c xamarin or c all compile time static type checked languages firstly is just that there is no need for a compile step react native can update the js without having to reload compile and replace the previous application compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1 5min but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app  in this talk we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles how you can use tools like flow or typescript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods to prove the how simple and fast react native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage to top it all off you can even embed react into existing native apps avoiding the need for a total rewrite 
__label__c 	traditionally diagnosing complex issues in c applications has been a dark craft involving complex high overhead tools that you absolutely can t apply in a production environment but things have changed there are great tools and techniques available for both linux and windows to debug diagnose and profile c applications  in this talk we will investigate multiple scenarios on both operating systems high cpu load blocked threads heavy i o memory leaks initialization issues and more we will use freely available lightweight production ready tools that do not require application restart and can be easily deployed alongside your c application on linux we will use the versatile perf multi tool the venerable ftrace and the bleeding edge bpf kernel technology on windows we will use etw event tracing for windows and the windows performance toolkit we will also talk about debugging symbols debuginfo or pdbs required for getting effective call stacks and demangling method names to something more or less readable 
__label__continuous delivery __label__devops __label__architecture	have you ever heard the phrase we tried buzzword and it didn t work for us it used to be agile but now devops is the new process buzzword and we can expect to hear about devops failures more and more frequently when the heavily hyped process starts failing or slowing you down it s tempting to throw it away and go back to the way things were but the problems can be easy to find and fix if you know where to look  this session is all about why devops works when it works why it fails when it fails and how to analyse your devops process and pipeline to make it as efficient and effective as possible first i ll introduce some guiding principles for a good devops pipeline that are important for self evaluation and repair then we ll look at where the buildup of sewage often occurs for organisations new to devops and of course how to clean things up before they get too smelly if you re sceptical of the new buzzword or are frustrated by your current process this talk is for you

__label__serverless __label__microservices __label__architecture	serverless computing is the hot new thing like any hyped technology it promises a lot however questions remain around concept and implementation especially when you start to compare how we ve built systems in the past and what serverlessoffers us now is serverless the future or just the emperor s new clothes  this talk will very briefly introduce serverless computing but will then dive into some of the questions that aren t always asked in conjunction with this technology topics will include how does your attitude to security change is it easier or harder to create reliable resilient systems do patterns like circuit breakers and connection pools make sense any more is vendor lock in a problem is serverless computing only for microservice architectures which problems fit serverless computing by the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer cut through some of the hype and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations 
__label__c 	c 11 gave us lambdas in the language for the first time if you ignore boost lambda so it s a functional language now right there s a bit more to functional programming than having first class function objects i d even argue we still don t quite have that but does that mean we can t do functional programming in c yes no maybe  first we have to define what functional programming actually is and it may not be quite what you think then we need to see what valuable ideas have come out of the functional approach to software design and which ones we can use in c to good effect in the end we ll see that while not strictly a functional programming language we can get quite a long way with immutable data types persistent data structures atomic references and if you re not watching carefully we might even throw the m word in there all this based on real world experience not just theoretical 
__label__database	sql databases aren t trendy anymore but their general purpose nature can still be extremely useful for reducing complexity in your system architecture bespoke databases seem to crop up daily in the name of performance or functionality this talk will examine the field of time series databases and look in depth as to how postgresql can be used for the purpose despite often being overlooked databases of this nature have seen an explosive resurgence in recent years and are often employed in monitoring systems to collect system and application metrics but also in the growing world of iot  the form of data stored by these systems is nothing to be afraid of relational databases have been storing it for a long long time what does seem to be happening is a convergence on a data model and access pattern leading to the emergence of more out of the box solutions an assertion of this talk is that for plenty of use cases postgresql is more than capable of storing all of this data at considerable scale of course we are told to use the right tool for the job but having to learn and operate a single tool instead of many can be a huge operational advantage we ll get quite technical in this talk take a look the data models and access patterns required and how this can be fitted into the general purpose environment of postgresql additionally it is always constructive to look at what can be problematic not just focus on the positives and see why many turn to other bespoke solutions 
__label__agile	when you release your software and products into the world you open yourself up to the gamut of possibilities this includes negative feedback from customers that can leave even the most experienced developer unprepared  this is something that applies to every developer and unfortunately usually doesn t get addressed until it is too late causing entire product pivots for non issues how can you stay on track when everything you hear tells you you re wrong provide developers with a framework for filtering customer requests while still keeping them engaged provide teams with a perspective on how to understand their customer 
__label__ net	the net platform has been in decline over the last four years losing half if its available positions in server side development in this presentation we look at the data behind that decline and ask what happened and what can we do to reverse it  in 201i bob eel called for a java renaissance to capitalize on new developments on the java platform and fight off the competition from frameworks like ruby on rails the numbers show that renaissance having an impact on server side java development and many web scale companies have returned to java for their server workloads can we make a similar move in net and create a renaissance that will see net taking a role server side in web scale deployments part history lesson and part call to action this talk tries to set out where we could go if the community can create a net renaissance around the net core developments
