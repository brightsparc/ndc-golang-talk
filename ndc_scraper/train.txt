	TensorFlow is growing in popularity as the go-to tool for Deep Learning and building complex AI systems. But there is also a lot of misconception about the capabilities of the platform and how and by whom it can be used in the most efficient way. Is TensorFlow the silver bullet of AI? Does one need to gain a lot of preliminary knowledge before starting to use the library or can it just be treated as a black box? In this talk, Barbara will start with three statements and drill down into each of them to reveal the holistic view on what TensorFlow is capable of, what are the limitations and what is needed to start working with the library. The session will cover the following areas: - Required experience and knowledge when approaching TensorFlow - Principal concepts and components of the library (Tensors, GPU computing, Deep Learning) - Methods and applications in the AI field After the session, the audience will have a clear idea what TensorFlow is and what it is not. The attendees will be able to start their journey with the library and apply it to tackle problems like Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing.
__label__microsoft __label__languages __label__net	Ever wanted to know how your favorite C# language features come to life, what the performance implications are, etc.?  Then this 100% hardcore demo session is for you! Fasten your seatbelts for a browse through the Roslyn compiler code, inspection of generated IL code, and the occasional dive into WinDbg to inspect JITted code.
	What if I told you that there is a way that you could modify almost any compiled .NET application and bend it to your will? What would you do with that power? New .NET languages and new language paradigms might come and go, but the Common Language Runtime is forever. This two-day workshop will teach you how to read, modify, write, and extend your applications in C# using IL, the only language that the CLR understands. By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to modify your .NET applications so that you can: When you harness the power of IL, you are no longer limited by the constraints of your compiler. You become the compiler. Join me, and I'll show you just how deep this rabbit hole goes. The expected audience includes developers who have a deep understanding of the C# language and want to take their language skills even further by understanding the code that is emitted by the C# compiler. Prior knowledge of IL assembler/disassembler is highly recommended, but completely optional. Attendees will need to bring a computer with Visual Studio 2015, Update 1 installed. 
__label__languages __label__functionalprogramming	Have you ever peeked over the fence into functional programming land and gazed into a seemingly alien landscape of weird symbols and crazily named concepts? Has your curiosity about functional programming been stymied by complicated words and abstractions? If so, this talk is for you. We’re going to take a practical, example-based journey through complex-sounding but deceptively simple functional patterns such as functors, applicatives and the big bad monad. We’ll see how these patterns work, what they’re for and how they are used to make clean, composable code. We’ll also identify the places where functional patterns are quietly being used in our mainstream day to day languages. By the end of the talk, you will be better equipped to take further steps down the functional programming path of enlightenment.
__label__design __label__functionalprogramming __label__net	Statically typed functional programming languages encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers. Types can be used to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self documenting way. And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test — making sure that your code is correct at compile time. In this talk, we'll look at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain driven design process, with some simple real world examples in F#. No jargon, no maths, and no prior F# experience necessary.

__label__machinelearning __label__javascript __label__web __label__cloud __label__fun	Want to build a Node.js app that detects landmarks in your photos, analyzes text sentiment, and translates text into 100+ languages? You could build your own machine learning models, but there’s still a lot of work involved and sometimes you just want an npm module that can tell you if your vacation photo has a dinosaur in it. It's not as easy as `npm install machine-learning`, but this is the next best thing.  With a bit of machine learning magic, you can access the same ML technology used in Google Photos, "Ok, Google", and Google Translate. In this talk, we’ll provide an overview of these APIs, show you how to use them in Node.js and risk it all with a live demo. We'll end with a peek into the Node.js community by querying terabytes of data.

Last but not least, we will explore some modern Web APIs that will make building PWAs a much more robust experience.
__label__devops	Docker enables microservice architectures and is the leader in containerization technology. On one hand, working with Docker greatly simplifies development and DevOps workflows. On the other hand, to achieve distribution and scale we need to take advantage of orchestration platforms - which are many.  This session will take you on a tour from the fundamentals of Docker, to the important concepts that support enterprise deployments including service distribution and scheduling, resource constraints, server density, scale, self-healing, diagnostics and management. While illustrating these features, you'll get a high level tour of several Docker platforms including Docker Swarm, Docker Data Center, Azure Container Service, Mesophere DC/OS, Kubernetes and Amazon EC2 Container Services (ECS).
	Azure Service Fabric provides a unique offering for microservices that can greatly reduce the overall effort to develop, deploy, manage and scale your solutions.  In this workshop you will get hands on experience developing with Service Fabric and taking advantages of its unique capabilities such as stateful and stateless services, leveraging the actor model, deploying containers and guest processes, and getting a full tour of the lifecycle of a microservice solution with this platform. You’ll learn about core features and design strategies through illustrations and demos, and gain some useful tips from customer experiences on the platform. Hands on labs will be included.

__label__mobile	React Native is an open source library from Facebook and Instagram that allows you to write your mobile apps using JavaScript. A React Native app consists of both JavaScript and a native code (either Java for Android, or Objective-C for iOS). The JavaScript code runs in a virtual machine on your mobile device and communicates with the native code through a JSON message passing interface. With React Native, you code the UI of your mobile app using a set of components in JavaScript. These components are then rendered natively on the respective mobile platform. For developers, React Native supports live reload and hot reload, allowing you to immediately see the changes you have made to your app without lengthy recompilation and redeployment. What's more, React Native supports live updates, allowing your app to be dynamically updated without republishing to the AppStore or Google Play. In this session, you will learn how to use React Native to build Android apps. You will see how to start building your Android app within minutes and understand how live reload, hot load, and live updates work. 
__label__microsoft __label__cloud	What if you never had to touch one of those pesky, ever changing, frequently ambiguous reporting stories in the product backlog ever again? PowerBI is a software as a service platform which can be used to put the power of creating reports and dashboards directly in the hands of business users, letting them explore available data and constantly adapt reports and dashboards to current needs. These dashboards can be incredibly interactive and powerful, and can be embedded directly into your apps. In practice, it can be tough to get this right! Business users are often unfamiliar with raw data that applications make available, and can find it tough to keep reports current with rapidly changing apps. In this talk, I'll cover some tips and tricks learned from real world PowerBI usage, and taking advantage of some new PowerBI features, show how we can apply all our usual software development practices to this system to create a powerful, easy experience for everyone.
__label__functionalprogramming __label__net	The talk will present one of the underlying themes of my book on Functional Programming: the separation of logic from side effects.  FP not only gives us (1) power, and (2) safety, but equally importantly it brings (3) clarity, which is key to good software architecture and maintainability. One way in which FP helps us achieve this clarity is by building a discipline in isolating logic (which is pure, technology agnostic, and can be captured in a specification) from side effects (which are impure, technology specific, and the reason why customers pay for a product). While we certainly need both, the mainstream approach (side effects everywhere) leads to code that is difficult to maintain, test, and reason about. Conversely, a functional approach, in which logic and side effects are clearly separated, leads to more testable and reliable programs. The talk will firstly explain exactly what side effects are - there are various types. Then, for each type of side effect, code samples will be shown, and techniques will be explained for refactoring standard idioms to a more functional style, where side effects and logic are isolated.
__label__continuousdelivery __label__devops	Continuous Delivery is a popular term in Buzzword Bingo, but in this talk we'll look behind the curtain at how a small team in a large enterprise took a complex cloud based application that built and deployed in days, to building and deploying in an hour.

Happiness in the workplace is not some airy-fairy pipe dream, but cemented in reality as a key to unlocking our passion and unleashing our full potential in the workplace.  This session gets into the nitty-gritty stuff that can impede us kicking butt at work. The topics that will be covered are those common to many of us - dealing with a conflict with your boss, shifting to a more positive work-life balance (which I call 'work-life blend'), how to cope with workplace change, and the like - and provide strategies to deal with these in a positive and productive manner. The talk will also provide you with an understanding of the fundamentals of what makes different people happy at work - because happiness means different things to different people. You'll walk away with tools, case studies, and real-life examples of how *you* can kick butt at work.

__label__serverless __label__microservices __label__architecture	Serverless computing is the hot new thing. Like any hyped technology, it promises a lot. However questions remain around concept and implementation, especially when you start to compare how we've built systems in the past, and what serverlessoffers us now. Is Serverless the future, or just the emperor's new clothes?  This talk will very briefly introduce serverless computing, but will then dive into some of the questions that aren't always asked in conjunction with this technology. Topics will include: * How does your attitude to security change? * Is it easier, or harder, to create reliable, resilient systems? * Do patterns like Circuit breakers and connection pools make sense any more? * Is vendor lock-in a problem? * Is serverless computing only for microservice architectures? * Which problems fit serverless computing? By the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer, cut through some of the hype, and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations. 
__label__continuousdelivery __label__devops __label__architecture	What if your success is your downfall? This could easily have been the case when it came to a very large enterprise agency and its rapid adoption of Octopus Deploy.  When Accenture first installed and configured Octopus, scale was not in mind. They did not know the level of successful adoption that was about to take place. Before they knew it a new team was signing up every few days to use a system that was not designed for the load it was about to be put under. When we got involved, the server needed daily resuscitation and fire fighting, and the team responsible spent the majority of their time trying to keep the system running instead of on-boarding new teams. I will talk about the structure that was, how Octopus Deploy HA came to be, and how it took a year to transfer 300+ teams from an unstable group of servers, to a sysadmin’s nirvana in the cloud.
__label__debugging __label__devops __label__net	OK, great, you can now run your favorite ASP.NET app or console application on Linux using .NET Core. What happens next? In fact, what happens straight after deployment, when you discover memory leaks, surprising crashes, performance problems, and other woes -- in the production environment? The tools and profilers you're used to from Windows don't work on Linux, and a lot of them don't have easy-to-use alternatives. In this talk, we will review the current landscape of profiling and debugging .NET Core apps on Linux. We will talk about performance investigations using `perf`, the Linux performance multi-tool, which can collect stack traces of CPU samples and other interesting events from .NET Core applications. We will review LTTNG and how it's used by .NET Core as a replacement for Windows ETW events, and see how to collect LTTNG traces efficiently and extract useful insights from them. We will also talk about core dumps, how to generate them on Linux, and how to get .NET-specific information out of a core dump using lldb and SOS. Prepare for a bumpy ride of half-baked tools and command-line magic, with -- hopefully -- a rewarding end!

__label__web __label__architecture	Client side web technologies continue to advance at breakneck speed. The quest to deliver richer user experiences is relentless and due to the limitations of HTTP/1.x, we have been forced to develop various workarounds (domain sharding, spriting, resource concatenation and inlining) in a bid to optimize performance.  HTTP/2 has been designed with the modern web in mind and eliminates the need for such compensating hacks. In this session we'll take an in-depth look at web performance optimization; the best practices that have evolved; the game changing new features of HTTP/2; and most importantly what you need to do to deliver a world class HTTP/2 experience: - Why domain sharding, resource concatenation and image sprites are now anti-patterns - How server push is effectively resource inlining on steroids - What new best practices are possible with HTTP/2 - What techniques to apply during the transitional period from HTTP/1.x to HTTP/2 Additionally, we will look at the tooling available for working with HTTP/2 traffic and how we can ensure that we're getting the full benefit of HTTP/2 both client and server side.

So let's step back and start looking at Docker from, well, FROM scratch (and we'll understand just what that means). With minimal starting knowledge of Docker we'll look into what it is, cover off all the core concepts from images to containers, volumes to networks, and how we can compose environments. We'll also look at how to use Docker in Dev, not just DevOps and how containers can be useful tools without being something to run production infrastructure on.
__label__languages __label__net	The C# team has continued to strive for openness since first making the Roslyn repository open source on CodePlex 3 years ago. There are features in the language that have been developed entirely by community members. The C# language spec (draft) is published on GitHub. There's an entire repository dedicated to language proposal discussions. In this session, you'll learn how these changes should affect your relationship with the language, how to keep up with changes, and how to participate. We'll also survey significant upcoming changes to the C# language.

__label__machinelearning __label__functionalprogramming	Machine learning and data science are currently red-hot topics. Yet, while practitioners typically use a wide range of tools and languages, .NET is conspicuously absent from the conversation. Does this mean it isn't suitable, and that we should all move to Python?  In this talk, I'll argue that the .NET ecosystem has a compelling language for machine learning and data science, namely F#. I will give a general tour of what machine learning is about, and illustrate along the way how F# fits the domain beautifully, showcasing some recent developments in the ecosystem. 
__label__security	Social engineering is one of the biggest threats to our organisations as attackers use manipulation techniques to coerce people into revealing secrets about our companies to allow attackers to gain access to critical systems. In this talk we will look at some of the techniques used in social engineering and look at how to guard yourself against them. We will cover subjects like pre-texting, elicitation and body language as techniques for manipulating people.
__label__crossplatform __label__devops __label__net	Docker enables .NET developers to build containerized applications for Windows or Linux. Windows containers support full .NET Framework applications, which makes for a great migration story. With AspNetCore developers can target both Linux-based Docker containers or Windows containers. In either case you can now develop your applications on Windows using your favorite .NET developer tools - then build Docker images and run them as containers on Windows Server or Linux machines. In this session, you will learn to build AspNetCore applications that can target either Windows or Linux containers, without any changes to your code. You will also learn how to build or migrate full .NET Framework applications and deploy them as Windows Containers. Topics include common considerations as you work locally, running local Docker containers, preserving as environment settings, choosing the right base image, working with IIS or Kestrel, composing multiple containers, and working with a Docker Registry.
__label__machinelearning __label__design __label__iot __label__ux __label__ui	According to CEO Aaron Shapiro, the next big breakthrough in design and technology will be the creation of products, services, and experiences that eliminate the needless choices from our lives and make ones on our behalf, freeing us up for the ones we really care about: “Anticipatory design”. Rather than traditional UI/UX, where the tendency is to provide options in a participatory manner to determine a result, here you remove all choices from the user, and use predictive modeling to give an outcome to liberate them from so-called “decision fatigue,” “Flow not friction,” “convenience not choice,” and “efficiency not freedom” are the mantras of anticipatory design. In this talk, we’ll explore some implementations of anticipatory design, discuss areas where it is done well, and issues with the overall movement.
__label__functionalprogramming __label__net	In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.

	Octopus deploy is tool that makes it easy to ship your products faster and more reliably. It is for developers of all stripes, from small teams developing embedded software for trucks, to large corporations with hundreds of projects and thousands of servers.  In this hands-on workshop, we will cover everything from basic deployment to advanced scenarios such as auto-scaling and tenanting. Along the way we will explore the various building blocks the application provides that make automating your deployments simple. By the end of the workshop you will have the knowledge and experience to implement, configure and maintain an Octopus Deploy enabled deployment pipeline in your organisation. Developers, testers, and anyone else who has a hands-on interest in DevOps, continuous deployment and automation, regardless of the platform, language or operating system used. No previous experience required. You will need to bring your own laptop. A locally running copy of Windows and SQL Server (Full or Express) with administrative access is required for some of the hands on topics. 
__label__security	Testing is a key part of development lifecycle, from checking your functional requirements actually work to constraining development to keep code focused and concise (TDD). Security testing however is often not conducted inside our lifecycle. We often wait until development is completed and ask third party penetration testing firms to find our issues for us.  This is a particularly bad idea in fast paced development teams. Bugs are often missed or are found too late to remediate. Cost of remediation escalates and our systems become tightly coupled and increasingly fragile as a result. Why would we want to finish engineering before finding fundamental security issues? Shouldn't we try to find these as early and often as possible? Shouldn't we take every opportunity to identify security flaws in our applications? SafeStack helps teams weave security testing into their own testing lifecycle and tool chains without compromising agility or innovation. This course is aligned with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 application security vulnerabilities as well as providing solid grounding in how to bring security into their testing toolsets and working practices. This includes: This course is designed to be hands on and interactive. Lecture material is combined with a range of custom built labs and exercises to test students and let them experiment with the security in action. Software testers engaged in or curious about automation. Some knowledge of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities would be useful but not essential. Delegates will need to bring a laptop with the ability to run a virtual machine (to be provided).

In this workshop, we’ll take a 100% hands-on approach, and learn practical ideas from Machine Learning, by tackling real-world problems and implementing solutions in F#, in a functional style.  In the process, you will see that once you get beyond the jargon, F# and Machine Learning are actually not all that complicated – and fit beautifully together. So if you are curious about what Machine Learning is about, and want to sharpen your developer skills, come with your laptop and… let’s hack together! You will need a laptop with an IDE or editor running F#; check for instructions on how to get setup. 
__label__ux	The combination of primary tenants of an engaging user experience and the revolution in the Natural User Interface (NUI) provides a great opportunity to enhance the overall user experience of applications. As the world of NUI evolves, and revolutionary devices like Kinect for Windows pave the path for gesture and voice controlled interfaces, there is a demand for developers to create increasingly sophisticated user experiences in their applications. A touch, gesture or voice optimized experience requires developers to think of visual design in a whole new way and demands a new set of usability skills. This demo focused keynote will take an amusing look at the past and take an impressive look at some of the best NUI software being built today and into the immediate future and will even delve into the NUI of the future. Over 7 years ago, in 2009, I “tongue and cheeked” a prediction: ‘We are within a Decade of Building the “Holodeck.”’ And the press picked up on that quote. Now here we are with a Microsoft Hololens device that manifests environments which span the chasm between physical and virtual; The ultimate Emerging Experience.
__label__craftsmanship __label__net	There are .NET libraries that are complex to setup, hard to understand, difficult to debug, and impossible to extend. And then there are .NET libraries for the same task that wonderfully just work. Why do some libraries succeed where others fail? In this session we will discuss what makes a well designed API, from high level design principles like The Pit of Success, The Wall of Complexity, and The Power of Sameness, to applying those concepts in low level .NET class design, with the goal of creating .NET libraries that developers love to use.
__label__serverless __label__microsoft __label__cloud	In this session I will look how developers can leverage the Microsoft Azure PaaS services to compose, publish and expose their APIs to their target audience, be it internal, external or a mix. I will look at Azure API Management, Azure API Apps, Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions as components that developer can leverage in their API strategies.
__label__security __label__net	Not encrypting your data is a risky move and just relying on hope that you won't get hacked and compromised is not a strategy. As a software developer you have a duty to your employer to secure and protect their data. In this talk, you will learn how to use the .NET Framework to protect your data to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authentication. This talk covers random number generation, hashing, authenticated hashing, and password based key derivation functions. The talk also covers both symmetric and asymmetric encryption using DES, Triple DES, AES, and RSA. You then learn how to combine these all together to product a hybrid encryption scheme which includes AES, RSA, HMACS, and Digital Signatures.

__label__security __label__devops __label__agile	Agile development is a powerful tool for the creation of high-quality software products. It has however scared the life out of many security managers and risk leaders. Once the job of a dedicated security team, security is now the responsibility of all members of our Agile teams. So how do we bring continuous security to our lifecycles without compromising velocity and innovation? What tools and techniques do we need and when should we apply them? In this talk, we will examine why security is the new key skills for successful Agile development teams and what you can do to bring it to your teams. This is a talk of war stories from the SCRUM team trenches and real world tools, techniques and processes that are less about 'managing' security than they are about building amazing(secure) things, fast.

	When we discover—often late in a project or even after a launch—that what we built isn’t accessible to people with disabilities, we can feel both frustrated and defeated. As professionals working on the web, we're champions for the user, but with accessibility, we aren't even sure how to start. As designers and developers, how can we account for everyone's needs when there are so many competing priorities? What do we know about users with disabilities and how they interact with our content? How can we incorporate inclusive practices into what we build without negatively impacting our designs? And, how can we possibly make this scalable with agile teams?  In this interactive workshop created for anyone who participates in the UX and development process, Elle Waters guides attendees on how to consider accessibility at each stage of a project and within each role. Learn how to start with inclusive design principles and how to build those principles and techniques into the process. Elle provides easy-to-adopt techniques for designers, developers, and testers. Learn core principles that you can start putting into practice tomorrow. A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design principles.

A quick walk through of and a pointer to the sample code so you can adapt the technique for your own evil purposes. -------------------- In this lightning talk I'll be going through some of the challenges, gotchas, WTFs and FTWs that I've experienced while starting to develop in Go (on Windows). Although traditionally a .NET/C# dev, I thought I should make an attempt to learn something new. Go is cool and shiny, so I thought I'd combine my love of all things Azure with the new "shiny shiny". -------------------- Do you know that your favorite cafe is following Kanban possibly even without knowing about it. I'm going to explain how they manage their flow and keep work in progress limits in check using very simple yet effective methods. -------------------- Customers come in all shapes and sizes. Some will use your products exactly as you intend while others will go way beyond your expectations. This is perfectly normal, possibly the price of success, but it can result in all kinds of problems that you didn't expect. Problems can range from terrible performance to usability issues where the user interface becomes useless. It can be surprising when a dashboard that looks great for ten records can be completely unusable when it displays a thousand records. This can be far more frustrating than a page that is simply slow to load. Octopus Deploy, a friendly .NET deployment automation tool, has to contend with this problem. Some customers have a single project, and some have thousands. It's a challenge designing for everyone. This session is all about thinking about scale when building and designing the user interface of your apps and web sites. We’ll review the lessons learned from growing Octopus Deploy and offer actionable tips that you can apply on the projects you're building right now. Techniques and patterns to display empty state, one thing, some things and too many things. This is still a work in progress so you'll see the good, the bad and the ugly. The goal of this presentation is to help you design your apps so they work great for all your customers. -------------------- Bots have grown in popularilty, but their utility to consumers is questionable. Where bots are extremely useful to are to technical teams. The tech team at Domain have written dozens of bots to automate and improve workflows around many, many of our internal tasks. We have started to look out our chat tools as a shared, transparent and pretty command line interface. In this talk I'll cover a range of examples and provide inspiration to go back to your work and start building some bots of your own. -------------------- Voice assistants have started to take over our lives in recent years, from Siri, Google and Cortana on mobile devices to Amazon Alexa in the centre of our homes. In this talk you will learn how to design great voice user interfaces that will make your voice assistants feel like a friend more than a robot to your users.

The good news you don't need it. In this lightning talk, we will setup, compile and run a F# program using nothing more than a text editor and .NETCore -------------------- Domain.com.au, one of Australia’s most visited websites, is built with the expectation that things can and will go wrong in production. Here are two simple techniques that are used to help stop small production failures from turning into disasters. -------------------- A corner stone of any solution is its build and release process. In this talk, I will demo why developers should use FAKE to build their DevOps process. There are many build / CI servers out there, and there are even more options for scripting something. However, coming up with something that can be adopted by everybody in the team, easy to use, and dependable, can be challenging. FAKE makes this a lot easier, especially when you have different environments, varying build agents (Windows/Mac/Linux), and multiple challenging build steps. I will show how FAKE could be used to simplify any build process, and I will demo parts of my real world DevOps process.

__label__microsoft __label__ui __label__net __label__mobile	Xamarin Forms is a fantastic abstraction on top of iOS, Android, Windows and Mac. It allows you to write one UI that is shared between platforms using the underlying UI controls native to each OS. The downside to this is the lowest-common-denominator model - only the features that are available on all platforms are provided out of the box. Luckily Xamarin provides a swathe of techniques to allow you to add platform specific tweaks. In this session we will look at some of these techniques, from the small number of platform specifics provided out of the box by Xamarin, to writing effects and implementing your own custom renderers. Each technique will be demonstrated with a live coded example showing just how easy they are to get working. By the end of this session you will have an understanding of the different tools you can use to make platform-specific tweaks to the UI, and be able to write your own effects and custom renderers.
__label__softskills	While startups can be great for venture capitalists, they're usually a poor deal for the participants. After working crazy hours for months or years, you face depressingly low odds of success. But there's another way: By finding a niche and deliberately staying small, you can dramatically up the chance of success - while balancing income, hours and lifestyle. Without having to answer to investors or an employer. The rules for a software lifestyle business are very different to the rules for a start-up. In this session, I'll share what I've learned over the past 10 years, writing and selling a successful programming utility. We'll cover both technical and business topics, including idea incubation, marketing, competitive analysis and monetization, as well as practical tips on payment processing, dealing with large corporations and resellers, providing support, and maximizing productivity and happiness while sole-programming.
__label__architecture __label__cloud	At GitHub we host a large number of wildly different projects and are the de-facto destination for many people. This means we see a lot of different use-cases come through our services. Sometimes it's the shape of the data, sometimes its size, sometimes it's an unexpected combination of both for a novel use-case that makes it harder to host. In this talk we'll see how GitHub has developed projects like Spokes and Lariat to make sure we can host these Git repositories reliably, from replication and heuristics to caching and application of quotas, they help make sure a project with over-eager CI systems or expensive Git processing requirements does not endanger the overall reliability of the system.

__label__javascript __label__functionalprogramming	We spend a lot of time building our libraries and applications. They can get complex, and feel like they can get out of control. Functional Programming is an approach that lets us zoom in and stay focused on small parts of a codebase at a time. We'll dig down into what Functional Programming (FP) is, where things like "immutability", "effects as values" and "functional-style" code come from, and what practical benefit it all has. This talk will demonstrate you can do FP in pretty much any language, and will be illustrated with real examples from JavaScript and a smattering of other languages. Some experience with at least one language, though, is about all you'll need to follow along. Warning: absolutely no type theory or abstract monadic contravariant functors will appear in this talk.
	Kotlin is a programming language developed by JetBrains that targets multiple platforms including the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native support in the works.

__label__languages __label__web __label__architecture __label__mobile	The API economy is here, fueling disruption across many established industries. REST, as specified in Roy Fielding’s seminal dissertation, has become the architectural pattern of choice for APIs and when applied correctly allows for clients and servers to evolve in a loosely coupled manner. There are areas however where REST can deliver less than ideal client experiences. Often many HTTP requests are required to render a single view.  While this may be a minor concern for a web app running on a WAN with low latency and high bandwidth, it can yield poor client experiences for mobile clients in particular. GraphQL is Facebook’s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an exciting alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly types, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need. In this session, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build APIs that are a joy to use.

__label__serverless __label__functionalprogramming __label__net	In essence, Azure Functions give you the ability to take a small piece of code, and painlessly deploy and run it in the cloud. Not surprisingly, then, Functions shine for "programming in the small", for instance scripting automated tasks. But what if you wanted to build a serious application, Serverless style? Unless you are careful, you will probably quickly end up with a spaghetti of functions on your hands. Azure Functions make some problems disappear, but also introduce issues of their own, without much guidance available. In this talk, we'll explore what types of challenges can arise and why, and present some techniques to help you grow Serverless code and staying sane.

__label__microservices	There is lots of theory out there about microservice architecture, but how often do you get to put that knowledge into practice? It's not feasible to re-architect your real system often, and certainly not in a single day, or is it? This brand new workshop from the author of Building Microservices gives you a safe space to explore ideas behind microservice architectures with peers from other organisations. In this workshop, we'll share some framing for microservice architectures that explore the various forces that can drive the design and evolution of microservices, and then you'll participate in a series of interactive architectural kata exercises to put your newfound knowledge to the test. Afterwards, you'll have a series of tools to take back to your own organisations to put into practice. This is a participatory workshop. You won't get to just sit there and watch – the more you participate in the workshop, the more you'll get out!
__label__devops __label__web __label__net __label__cloud	Every website will inevitably experience issues in production. This is a story of how Domain.com.au, one of Australia’s most visited websites, experienced one such issue, how it overcame it, and what lessons were learned along the way.
	Modern application design has changed quite a bit in recent years. “Mobile-first” and “cloud-ready” are the types of applications you are expected to develop. Also, to keep pace with these demands, Microsoft has revamped their complete web stack with ASP.NET Core to meet these architectural demands. Needless to say, you also have to secure these apps. Multi-platform, multi-client, and highly-mobile users bring a new set of challenges, so the approaches of the past are no longer appropriate for modern applications. This two day workshop is your chance to dive into all things security related to these new technologies. Learn how to securely connect native and browser-based applications to your back-ends and integrate them with enterprise identity management systems as well as social identity providers and services. This workshop covers everything you need to know to build modern and secure web, native & mobile applications. The foundation will be Microsoft’s latest technology stack but will also include IdentityServer4, which is the officially recommended framework for building token services. .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, MVC, Web APIs, Claims, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, WS-Federation, SAML, JSON Web Tokens, Single Sign-on and off, Federation, Delegation, Home Realm, Discovery, CORS Attendees will need to bring a computer with Visual Studio 2017
__label__microsoft __label__web __label__cloud	Building a highly available application in the cloud can be difficult given the nature of distributed systems.  In this session we will look at patterns we can apply to our system as well as features we can use in Microsoft Azure to build system that are resilient to faults and disasters, such as Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Service Bus. 
__label__softskills	Have you ever thought about how many amazing things we get in this day and age for free? Think about it, whether it’s articles in daily newspapers, social media, your code repository, your continuous integration server as a service. And that’s not even mentioning all the amazing open source libraries, frameworks that are all out there. It’s all free, and it’s awesomesauce! But (isn’t there always a but) in reality, someone is paying for all this. Sometimes it’s being paid for with cash, other times in the form of data and in many cases in the form of liabilities. Many of us choose to ignore this and gaze at the wonder of it all. One day however, we’ll wake up and ask where our free lunch has gone and surprised that things start crumbling down.
__label__net	"Microsoft Heart Linux" is a big statement backed up by exciting software releases that give the .Net developer more choices than ever before. But how to get started? Brendan is a former Linux fundamentalist turned .Net Developer and this this talk will cover an essential introduction to Linux, package management and command-line basics - before going on to deploy a .NET Core web application.
	Elasticsearch is a real-time, distributed, scalable and highly available search and analytics engine used by thousands of companies worldwide for a multitude of search, logging and analytics use cases. In this hands-on workshop, we'll focus on getting up and running with Elasticsearch as a .NET developer, building out an ASP.NET Core application whilst exploring features of Elasticsearch, to create a great user experience. We will cover: By the end, you'll have a good understanding of how to incorporate Elasticsearch into your own projects to extract further value from your data. No prior knowledge of Elasticsearch or Information retrieval is assumed or required. Delegates should have experience with C#. Delegates will have to bring a laptop with an IDE installed to work with .NET (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider) and JVM installed (Windows, Mac or Linux). 
__label__security __label__net	Authentication is easy – authorization is the hard part. This might sound daunting, but since every application is different, there is no single recipe for how authorization has to work. Dominick walk you through a couple of approaches and pitfalls and use the new ASP.NET Core authorization API (which has been back-ported to standard .NET) as an example of a decent abstraction layer for clean authorization for your applications. But we will also learn that that regardless of your approach, there is no one size that fits all – that’s why it important to understand your options.
__label__machinelearning __label__web __label__net __label__cloud	For years human needed to understand computers and learn how to use them to get the result they wanted. Nowadays, this model has been flipped and computers are trying to understand human conversations. Latest data indicates that messenger apps have been used more than social networking websites. Are you prepared to leverage from this behavioural change? Chatbot increases the customer engagement and improves customer experience by focusing on the simplicity. It provides personalised content and an intuitive experience. In this session Microsoft Technical Evangelists Jordan and Azadeh will walk you through conversational UI concepts and Cognitive Services; what they are and the problems they solve before we delve into the new world of easily accessible intelligent services, framed by modern development techniques.
__label__languages __label__functionalprogramming	If you use C# in your day job, and hate having to leave your ADTs behind, you don't have to! Come and see how you can incorporate sum and product types into your existing C# projects. A significant number of professional developers use C#, which does not natively support immutable sum and product types. Immutable algebraic data types are an invaluable tool for proper problem modeling, because they focus on keeping illegal states from being representable. This talk is about how to practically introduce ADTs into C# by the use of DSLs and code generation. We will dive into how ADTs can be represented, implemented with native C# constructs, and used with pattern matching and partial modification. We’ll conclude with the mechanics of parsing and code generation, look at an open source library and tool, and discuss practical integration of FP patterns into daily work in C#. Immutable algebraic data types are an invaluable tool for proper problem modeling, because they focus on keeping illegal states from being representable. However, many programmers who use C# in their day jobs do not get the benefits of these types. This talk will: 1. Briefly introduce ADTs and their use (most people at LC would already know this). 2. Discuss how a Product and Union Type can each be implemented with classes. 3. Talk about Value Semantics and how to implement it with classes. 4. Introduce a code generator to generate the boilerplate. 5. Introduce a DSL to represent Product and Union Types and hook it up to the code generator. 6. Integrate the whole thing into Visual Studio to provide a seamless extension to allow using ADTs within existing C# projects. 7. Extend a DU defined in the DSL with C# to provide type-class support for Functor, Applicative and Monad, and integrate into LINQ to show that the generated code is extensible.
__label__web __label__architecture __label__cloud	It seemed like an easy feature to implement, a checkout page to place an order. But this payment gateway has a simple API, so we added that. And this email service provider makes it possible to send an email with one line of code! Finally we can notify downstream systems via a message queue. The code looks simple, 6 little lines of distributed systems code. But those lines hid a dark secret that we only found after launching. Customers complained they didn't get their email. The back end system wasn't getting updated from our messages. And by far the worst of all, customers complained they saw an error page but still got charged! Clearly it wasn't as easy as calling a few APIs and shipping, we actually need to worry about those other systems. In this session, we'll look at taking our 6 lines of distributed systems fail, examining the inevitable failures that arise, and possible mitigating scenarios. We'll also look at the coupling our code contains, and the ways we can address it. Finally, we'll refactor towards a truly resilient checkout process that embraces, instead of ignoring, the fallacies of distributed computing.
__label__microsoft __label__net	So, you know how to start developing a mixed reality experience, but want to take it further and master more of the details that make it more immersive, more natural, more believable? This talk will introduce new concepts and build on existing ones for doing just that.  Learn how to take advantage of advanced gestures such as hold and manipulate, how to expand on voice commands, learn to master the developer tools such as the emulator and perception simulation, and much more. Get to grips with the development cycle and get into the details of the HoloLens development experience. At the end of this talk you will have the tools and knowledge to build more immersive and natural holographic experiences that take full advantage of mixed reality and isn’t merely an augmented or virtual experience.

__label__crossplatform __label__microsoft __label__net	While still being relatively niche, over the recent years C# scripting has grown to become a first class citizen in the Roslyn compiler and can now be enjoyed and applied in your applications in various ways. Together, we will dissect what’s going on under the hood in C# scripting and how you can make use of it in the cross platform, lightweight, .NET Core world (which, by the way, creates a perfect environment for low ceremony C# scripting). We'll also have a look at scripting via the new .NET CLI, how you can integrate it into your everyday development workflows and how you can debug the script assemblies.
__label__microsoft __label__net	Visual Studio 2017 contains many new and exciting features, new C# 7 language features and IDE productivity enhancements to support web and cloud development, Windows app development, cross-platform mobile development and more.  The latest version of Visual Studio provides cutting-edge tools and technologies to create apps that take advantage of the latest platform capabilities, whether Windows, Android, iOS, or Linux. It's fastest, leanest version of Visual Studio ever. VS Code is Visual Studio 2017’s little brother. It’s lightweight, it’s free, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, and it’s a little rambunctious. VS Code aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to its big brother. Being lighter doesn’t mean it’s not better. Most of the serious Angular 2 devs at SSW already choose VS Code as their weapon of choice. Watch as Adam Cogan gives you a tour of these great IDEs and expands your development horizons. This session is guaranteed to make you even more productive and highlight why the Visual Studio family is awesome for developing software.
__label__architecture	We depend on Artificial Intelligences to solve many types of problems for us. Some of these problems have more than one possible solution. Handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern AI system is something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career. Figuring out the best way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine, finding the shortest path between two points, or determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions.  This session is a software developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in Artificial Intelligence. In it, we will explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems, and use the open-source Google OR-Tools to put them to work in our AI systems. Since this is a session for developers, we'll keep it in terms that work best for us. That is, we'll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math.
__label__continuousdelivery __label__security __label__devops __label__testing	Security has typically been done at the end of the development cycle if it’s done at all. This has all of the same side effects as testing quality just before shipping namely surfacing work and risk at the worst possible time. DevOps is forcing development teams to re-think their accountability. Not only are they responsible for functional quality but now they must also operationalize their software. I assert that they should also be accountable for security. They should treat security findings as equal citizens to their functional defects. Software written without security in mind opens a company up to brand damage and the costs associated with breaches. This will reflect directly on the teams that built the software. How can DevOps teams add security to DevOps without losing velocity? In this session, Peter Chestna, Director of Developer Engagement, discusses how security is typically bolted on to the development process as well as the pressures on DevOps teams. He will then provide practical strategies to integrate security successfully into the SDLC while maintaining the velocity necessary to realize the benefits of DevOps. What you will learn: 1. Why application security (AppSec) is important 2. Why traditional approaches don’t work 3. How to add security into DevOps while maintaining velocity 4. What to measure as leading indicators of success
__label__architecture	Go beyond the hype and build a solid foundation of theory and practice with this workshop on SOA development. Join Jimmy Bogard for a two day deep-dive covering architectural topics like: Skill Level: Senior developers, tech leads, and architects will benefit most from this workshop Computer setup: Participants are requested to bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2013 / 2015 installed.
__label__javascript __label__web	TypeScript is quickly becoming the dominant way to write maintainable self documenting JavaScript. This session will demonstrate some of the reasons why you should consider adding TypeScript to your JavaScript toolset. This will be followed by a tour of the new features that can help catch JavaScript bugs before they make their way to production. Since TypeScript is fast evolving (just like JavaScript) we will also cover how to keep up with the changes.
__label__security	So your team is part of a highly innovative, totally disruptive company/organisation/team/university department/cult and you're going to conquer the world? Wonderful. I'm happy for you. I'm the security person that unicorns call when they need to survive the dark and nasty side effects of becoming "the next big thing". With lessons learned from helping disruptive and fast paced (often low resourced) teams in 7 countries, let me share with you the reality of security when you are living on the bleeding edge of business and technology. This is more than just software security, this is survival.
__label__softskills __label__craftsmanship __label__people __label__fun	Git. As developers, many of us use it everyday. Invented in 2005, this distributed version control system helped facilitate development of a single code base by large teams. It’s an invaluable resource for software engineers. But what happens when you attempt to teach git to a photographer, business analyst, project manager, office manager, politician, or auto technician? Who would benefit from this seemingly random and industry-specific tool? And just how hard is it for “everyday people” to learn command line interfaces? Come learn why spreading the gospel of git can help make not only the tech, but the entire world go ‘round.
