__label__functional_programming __label__dotnet	the talk will present one of the underlying themes of my book on functional programming the separation of logic from side effects  fp not only gives us 1 power and 2 safety but equally importantly it brings 3 clarity which is key to good software architecture and maintainability one way in which fp helps us achieve this clarity is by building a discipline in isolating logic which is pure technology agnostic and can be captured in a specification from side effects which are impure technology specific and the reason why customers pay for a product while we certainly need both the mainstream approach side effects everywhere leads to code that is difficult to maintain test and reason about conversely a functional approach in which logic and side effects are clearly separated leads to more testable and reliable programs the talk will firstly explain exactly what side effects are there are various types then for each type of side effect code samples will be shown and techniques will be explained for refactoring standard idioms to a more functional style where side effects and logic are isolated

__label__dotnet	we ve all experienced deadlocks and we all hate them but how do we prevent and potentially fix them  that s right no one likes applications crashing or giving users an unexpected behaviour introducing asynchronous patterns is so much more than just applying async and await to your methods you really i mean really need to understand what s going on in this session we ll make sure you know how to avoid crashing your applications and how to adhear to best practices when applying asynchronous patterns in our dotnet applications 
__label__javascript __label__mobile	react native allows developers to create native cross platform using javascript or really anything that will compile to js c typescript or even f but why would you use react native how run time typed language like javascript be a better choice for developing apps than say swift java kotlin c xamarin or cpp all compile time static type checked languages firstly is just that there is no need for a compile step react native can update the js without having to reload compile and replace the previous application compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1 5min but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app  in this talk we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles how you can use tools like flow or typescript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods to prove the how simple and fast react native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage to top it all off you can even embed react into existing native apps avoiding the need for a total rewrite

__label__microservices	the good news is that if you are already designing for a microservices environment you are already positioned to do this with less pain services that fit in your head lead to a manageable number of messages or events allowing you to take a step toward this new message based system   in this session you ll learn how to design a microservices solution that first relies on message streams to produce state history and full audit as a baby step toward full blown event sourcing in the session you ll see patterns for structuring your solutions managing message and payload designs creating a hybrid without event sourcing whereby you have full history and audit and finally what the step to event sourcing might look like 
__label__architecture	 we value working software over comprehensive documentation is what the manifesto for agile software development says with the typical misinterpretation of these few words being don t write documentation  of course that s not what the manifesto says and no documentation certainly wasn t the intent it seems that many software teams have lost the ability to communicate what it is they are building and it s no surprise that these same teams often seem to lack technical leadership direction and consistency this session will look at various approaches and tools that you can use to visualise document and explore your software architecture in order to build a better team 
__label__devops	devops so hot right now so hot your managers have jumped on the buzzword bandwagon and have told you to make it happen but also not to subvert the company change process you can do that right  as tech professionals we know you can t just exchange cash for devops but how can you convince the higher ups particularly when upper management won t let go of the perceived safety of a slow moving product delivery cycle this session looks at the realities of implementing devops in an organisation that is resistant to change we ll discuss the levels of technical and cultural change that you absolutely need the barriers that commonly get in the way and some techniques to get around them expect subtle and possibly even underhanded tips to get things moving in an environment that just wants to use the word devops without making the necessary changes

__label__languages	coroutines are an old idea undergoing a resurgence in popularity as they facilitate highly concurrent applications without recourse to the complications and intricacies of threads and locks after many years of third party support for coroutine based concurrency in python the popular python language has recently introduced first class support with many new language features together with a supporting standard library called asyncio  coroutines are threads of execution implemented via resumable functions which when combined with a suitable scheduler can be used to support concurrency in the style of cooperative multitasking which can be simpler to reason about and easier to debug than the alternatives in the first part of this session we demonstrate the simplicity and essential qualities of coroutine based concurrency by building a simple concurrency framework from scratch in python 3 this efficiently removes any notion that there is any hidden magic in how coroutines work in practice we then by a series of simple mechanical transformations convert our home grown example into real python 3 code using the recently introduced async and await language features together with the asyncio library in the final part of the talk we explore some of the abstractions python 3 builds on top of coroutines such as futures tasks transports and asynchronous streams and demonstrate how to use these in a practical application this session can serve as an introduction to coroutine based concurrency for those new to the idea irrespective of programming language and window into how asynchronous programming in python works in theory and in practice around 80 of the session is code and live demonstration with 20 supporting material 
__label__dotnet	you are effective with the imperative object oriented core of dotnet but you look longingly at the winsome smile of functional languages maybe you play with your language s functional features never quite sure you re getting it right or taking full advantage of them  this is the talk is for you you ll learn which code to attack with functional ideas and how to do it you ll watch code transform from long difficult to follow code to short code that s easy to understand hard to mess up and straightforward to debug better yet functional approaches ensure that patterns like async logging and exception handling are consistent and transaction usage is clear apply these techniques while leveraging delegates lambda expressions base classes and generics you ll leave this talk ready to implement these approaches in any version c 3 or above 
__label__serverless	serverless computing is the hot new thing like any hyped technology it promises a lot however questions remain around concept and implementation especially when you start to compare how we ve built systems in the past and what serverless offers us now is serverless the future or just the emperor s new clothes  this talk will very briefly introduce serverless computing but will then dive into some of the questions that aren t always asked in conjunction with this technology topics will include by the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer cut through some of the hype and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations 
__label__microsoft __label__dotnet	msbuild is the build engine for dotnet while it is powerful and flexible it can also be verbose opaque and complex to work with if you ve been following the development of dotnet core you may have felt like the project json project file format was a breath of fresh air and been dismayed at the decision to as the build engine for dotnet core  however all is not lost as part of moving the dotnet core tooling to msbuild we ve also made major improvements to msbuild and to the end to end project experience we ve taken the goodness that project json had like simple human editable project files and easy multi targeting and brought it to the new and improved csproj files in this session we ll look at how to work with these new and improved project files we ll see how to customize the defaults that are applied to the project how to multi target to different dotnet targets and how to consume and create nuget packages then we ll cover the basics of msbuild learn how to extend and integrate with the build process and learn to investigate and debug problems with our builds when we re done you should be confident in your ability to take advantage of the improvements to msbuild projects extend the build process with your own operations and investigate and fix problems you encounter with your build

__label__cross_platform __label__microsoft __label__cloud	have you ever called or wanted to call a microsoft api spent the hours digging through documentation searching for libraries supporting your development stack and figuring out the security piece that needs to go into it later to find out that none of your learnings would apply for your next api to call  now let s learn about the microsoft graph which aims to solve all of the above a unified endpoint built with standards we love for microsoft apis this means calling everything from outlook onedrive excel rest apis office 365 sharepoint and much more with tons of code i will teach you how to get started from any development stack i ll show you some real world code and what i think is brilliant about the microsoft graph and tell you where to look out in addition we ll cover how we think about building and evolving our future apis we ll try to predict the future and grasp why this is something for everyone to care about 
__label__machine_learning __label__languages __label__web __label__cloud __label__fun	so you have heard lots of people talking about golang thinking that it s probably just one of these fads that will disappear but it s community is still active and growing so what is all the fuss about  in this talk i will distill my experience from moving from c to golang and talk to some specific use cases where golang excels as well as demonstrate how seek is using golang as key part of their infrastructure for deploying data science models 
__label__microservices	go faster than your competitors that s the promise of microservices deploy faster scale faster be more robust it s all about outcomes and the way your organisation is structured has a tremendous impact on those outcomes it s easy to say conway s law and then move swiftly on but but but but how  in early 2014 james and martin fowler called out organised around business capabilities as a core characteristic of microservices this was based on feedback from successful teams around the world about how important this aspect was on the systems they were building in this talk james explores some of these structures and provides some practical guidance on what he and martin meant when they said business capability 
__label__javascript __label__web	angular is a next generation javascript platform for building mobile web and desktop applications  in this workshop we will build a crm application with angular using components services dependency injection forms angular modules and lazy loaded routes we will then cover unit tests and using the redux pattern with the ngrx library by the end of this workshop you will have built a working angular applications you can extend into an enterprise application you will also walk away with the source code and the course material so join us to learn to build great enterprise applications with angular day 1 day 2 you need to bring your own laptop with the below software installed to follow this workshop if you get stuck we can help you on the day but it helps to have this already installed we have made a for if you issues with the install 
__label__serverless __label__web	functions in the sky sounds like fun doesn t it ok yes there are servers involved but you don t have to manage them which means you can spend more time focusing on your business rather than hardware and infrastructure  wouldn t it be nice to eliminate docker once and for all in this talk rob conery will show you how he leverages firebase functions from google with his business bigmachine io we ll work with the firebase realtime database as well as postgresql hosted by compose com 
__label__microservices __label__security __label__architecture	microservices are all the rage and so are security breaches learn what you can do to create one without the other  microservices give us many options we can pick different technologies mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns but they also give us different options for how we think about securing our systems done right and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes done wrong and you can increase the surface area of attack this talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine grained distributed architectures developers architects technical leaders operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components the audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about appsec and also understand how microservices can help or hinder building a secure system 
__label__ethics	people have created objects for sexual purposes since prehistoric times their form and function has changed as technology changes from sex toys made of carved antler bone or stone to today s humanlike proto sex robots  despite this long history the development of sex technology is far from straightforward from legal and ethical issues to moral objections and funding problems taboo frequently stifles innovation in addition the gender gap so prevalent in tech remains particularly entrenched reinforcing stereotypes this talk will consider the ways in which diversity and acceptance might be achieved in the development of sex technology using the idea of the sex tech hackathon as an example of good practice 
__label__javascript __label__web __label__testing	writing frontend tests has always been hard let us show you how to make testing easier in your angular applications  from unit testing components and services to end to end testing your entire application we will give you tips and techniques for testing in the latest versions of angular 
__label__functional_programming	in times where a jungle of javascript frameworks wants to solve every conceivable problem in web app development creating headaches and javascript fatigue in the process elm offers a different approach  elm is a functional programming language that you can use instead of javascript or alongside it it builds on the concepts virtual dom and unidirectional data flow popularized by react and redux but with a sound typesystem built in immutability and an amazing compiler that catches errors before you even run your code simply put elm is a great language that will make your backend team jealous unless they re already on the very similar f in this talk you ll see how elm works and learn how to use it to build a web app i will emphasize the advantages and disadvantages it brings compared to the traditional javascript tech stack used at my most recent project this talk is not aimed at experienced functional programmers coming from languages such as haskell but rather javascript developers seeking a more functional approach in their daily work it serves both as a introduction to elm and typed ml style functional programming 
__label__cross_platform __label__javascript __label__web __label__functional_programming	let s acknowledge it javascript has conquered the world you ve it on the web on the server on the desktop on mobile everywhere like the language or not the truth is js developers have built an incredible ecosystem with libraries and tools to do almost anything if you want to enjoy all these development opportunities does it mean there s no choice but dealing with duck typing cryptic equality rules and undefined everywhere  no fable is an open source compiler that brings all the power of f to the js world the functional paradigm static typing with type inference pattern matching type providers and more together with a comprehensive library to handle collections text and observables among others fable doesn t add any runtime overhead and generates clean js code in conformance with new es6 patterns like modules or iterables making it compatible with modern development tools including github electron or react native to let you develop not only web but also cross platform desktop and mobile apps
