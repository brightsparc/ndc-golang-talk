__label__microsoft __label__ net	visual studio 2017 contains many new and exciting features new c 7 language features and ide productivity enhancements to support web and cloud development windows app development cross platform mobile development and more  the latest version of visual studio provides cutting edge tools and technologies to create apps that take advantage of the latest platform capabilities whether windows android ios or linux it s fastest leanest version of visual studio ever vs code is visual studio 2017 s little brother it s lightweight it s free it runs on windows mac and linux and it s a little rambunctious vs code aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code build debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to its big brother being lighter doesn t mean it s not better most of the serious angular 2 devs at ssw already choose vs code as their weapon of choice watch as adam cogan gives you a tour of these great ides and expands your development horizons this session is guaranteed to make you even more productive and highlight why the visual studio family is awesome for developing software 
__label__architecture	we depend on artificial intelligences to solve many types of problems for us some of these problems have more than one possible solution handling those problems with more than one solution while building a modern ai system is something every developer will be asked to do over the course of his or her career figuring out the best way to utilize the capacity of a device or machine finding the shortest path between two points or determining the best way to schedule people or events are all problems where mathematical optimization techniques and tooling can be used to quickly and efficiently find solutions  this session is a software developers introduction to using mathematical optimization in artificial intelligence in it we will explore some of the foundational techniques for solving these types of problems and use the open source google or tools to put them to work in our ai systems since this is a session for developers we ll keep it in terms that work best for us that is we ll go heavy on the code and lighter on the math 
__label__continuous delivery __label__security __label__devops __label__testing	security has typically been done at the end of the development cycle if it s done at all this has all of the same side effects as testing quality just before shipping namely surfacing work and risk at the worst possible time devops is forcing development teams to re think their accountability not only are they responsible for functional quality but now they must also operationalize their software i assert that they should also be accountable for security they should treat security findings as equal citizens to their functional defects software written without security in mind opens a company up to brand damage and the costs associated with breaches this will reflect directly on the teams that built the software  how can devops teams add security to devops without losing velocity in this session peter chestna director of developer engagement discusses how security is typically bolted on to the development process as well as the pressures on devops teams he will then provide practical strategies to integrate security successfully into the sdlc while maintaining the velocity necessary to realize the benefits of devops what you will learn 1 why application security appsec is important 2 why traditional approaches don t work 3 how to add security into devops while maintaining velocity 4 what to measure as leading indicators of success
__label__architecture	go beyond the hype and build a solid foundation of theory and practice with this workshop on soa development  join jimmy bogard for a two day deep dive covering architectural topics like skill level senior developers tech leads and architects will benefit most from this workshop computer setup participants are requested to bring a laptop with visual studio 2013 2015 installed 
__label__javascript __label__web	typescript is quickly becoming the dominant way to write maintainable self documenting javascript  this session will demonstrate some of the reasons why you should consider adding typescript to your javascript toolset this will be followed by a tour of the new features that can help catch javascript bugs before they make their way to production since typescript is fast evolving just like javascript we will also cover how to keep up with the changes 
__label__security	so your team is part of a highly innovative totally disruptive company organisation team university department cult and you re going to conquer the world wonderful i m happy for you  i m the security person that unicorns call when they need to survive the dark and nasty side effects of becoming the next big thing with lessons learned from helping disruptive and fast paced often low resourced teams in 7 countries let me share with you the reality of security when you are living on the bleeding edge of business and technology this is more than just software security this is survival 
__label__soft skills __label__craftsmanship __label__people __label__fun	git as developers many of us use it everyday invented in 2005 this distributed version control system helped facilitate development of a single code base by large teams it s an invaluable resource for software engineers  but what happens when you attempt to teach git to a photographer business analyst project manager office manager politician or auto technician who would benefit from this seemingly random and industry specific tool and just how hard is it for everyday people to learn command line interfaces come learn why spreading the gospel of git can help make not only the tech but the entire world go round
