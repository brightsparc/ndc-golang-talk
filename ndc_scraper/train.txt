__label__functional programming __label__ net	the talk will present one of the underlying themes of my book on functional programming the separation of logic from side effects  fp not only gives us 1 power and 2 safety but equally importantly it brings 3 clarity which is key to good software architecture and maintainability one way in which fp helps us achieve this clarity is by building a discipline in isolating logic which is pure technology agnostic and can be captured in a specification from side effects which are impure technology specific and the reason why customers pay for a product while we certainly need both the mainstream approach side effects everywhere leads to code that is difficult to maintain test and reason about conversely a functional approach in which logic and side effects are clearly separated leads to more testable and reliable programs the talk will firstly explain exactly what side effects are there are various types then for each type of side effect code samples will be shown and techniques will be explained for refactoring standard idioms to a more functional style where side effects and logic are isolated 
__label__continuous delivery __label__mobile	mobile maturity is low by now most companies have accepted the benefits of continuous delivery in web applications but interestingly fail to apply the same principles when it comes to mobile app development why because it s hard however the times are a changing to quote a recent nobel prize winner a second generation of tools and cloud services have recently become available and the barrier of entry is much low lower than most teams believe  come learn what s new in mobile devops from new microsoft in this talk we discuss the benefits of continuous delivery when applied to mobile but also challenges unique to mobile we show using live demos how easy it is to get started and provided value early on in project and this is accessible for everyone from indie developers to start ups to enterprises we conclude with practical tips from engineering teams who have been doing this for years now

__label__cross platform	git has some 157 commands each with several arguments that can take a number of possible values this complex matrix of seemingly infinite combinations unquestionably gives the impression of git being an incredibly hard to use source control management system that only linus torvalds and his closest friends are capable of truly understanding and using efficiently  however this is not the case in its simplest form git is just a file system and if you think of a file system like a graph or the other way around git is just a set of commands that lets you manipulate this graph so while the complex command matrix is indeed well complex the basics of git is not this workshop will make you understand the core of git and how the command matrix is basically just fluff very powerful and useful fluff but fluff nonetheless what git does is basically introductory high school graph theory in its simplest form if you understand nodes or points and edges or lines and are able to point your index finger at a node you should hopefully leave this talk a bit more informed and perhaps hate git an ounce less than you did before the talk after teaching the core of git the workshop will go on to show how you can use git flow gitversion and github in concert to become a much more efficient structured and overall better developer please bring your own laptop with the following installed 
__label__microservices __label__security __label__architecture	microservices are all the rage and so are security breaches learn what you can do to create one without the other  microservices give us many options we can pick different technologies mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns but they also give us different options for how we think about securing our systems done right and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes done wrong and you can increase the surface area of attack this talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine grained distributed architectures developers architects technical leaders operations engineers and anybody interested in the design and architecture of services and components the audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about appsec and also understand how microservices can help or hinder building a secure system

__label__continuous delivery __label__microservices __label__architecture __label__testing	when you move from a monolithic architecture towards a distributed microservices setup it makes some things easier but other things become harder testing is one of those things that has a bit of both compared to a monolith your tests probably have a lot more apis they can access each individual microservice can be tested in isolation with the rest of the system mocked or stubbed this can be really useful you can have greater confidence that the parts of your system work by themselves even quite large parts in my experience you don t get away from the need for end to end tests entirely though there can still be integration errors between the services if you can write tests that exercise your whole system while none of your own services are replaced by a test double you can find some pretty important issues before you deploy to production  i ve heard that many teams working with large scale microservices architectures are using techniques like incremental roll out and testing in production and don t do a lot of testing in a staging or pre production environment i don t think there s necessarily a either or decision to make there and i think it s worth doing some end to end tests before your code reaches the production infrastructure in this talk i ll share my experiences handling end to end automated tests in a pre production environment and some techniques i ve found particularly useful the first technique is to make the tests talk the same protocols as the microservices so the tests submit requests via rest then listen to all the relevant traffic being sent between the services while the request is processed the second technique i use is approval testing which allows me to verify the correct messages are being passed without test maintenance costs getting out of control the third technique is not so much about the actual tests but about how you configure your deployment pipeline so that the tests give the most useful feedback to development teams this is all about resolving the conflict that arises when you want to keep services and teams working independently while having tests that check they work together correctly

__label__functional programming	servant is a haskell library that implements a domain specific language for web apis at the type level by specifying the api as types you get a clean separation of http logic and the value level handlers also since the type checker has knowledge about the various endpoints and where they live it will be able to verify that all handlers return the correct types and headers and that internal uris are correct  implementing a server i e a set of handlers for the http endpoints is just one of several uses of an api type however by traversing the type servant is also able to derive a swagger openapi specification for the api and even api client code in javascript and other languages we will look at how servant achieves a clean separation of http and business logic true to the core philosophy of http and rest by not just implementing a server for an api but also deriving a javascript client and a swagger openapi specification for the we will end up with an api with strong correctness guarantees and also documentation and client code that is guaranteed to be correct and up to date
