Some will use your products exactly as you intend while others will go way beyond your expectations. This is perfectly normal, possibly the price of success, but it can result in all kinds of problems that you didn't expect. Problems can range from terrible performance to usability issues where the user interface becomes useless. It can be surprising when a dashboard that looks great for ten records can be completely unusable when it displays a thousand records. This can be far more frustrating than a page that is simply slow to load. Octopus Deploy, a friendly .NET deployment automation tool, has to contend with this problem. Some customers have a single project, and some have thousands. It's a challenge designing for everyone. This session is all about thinking about scale when building and designing the user interface of your apps and web sites.

Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints. CSS3 animations allows animation of most HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash! In this presentation, you will learn how to bring life and interactivity to your site. ------------------------ As devices keep getting faster, people come to expect responsive and good-looking mobile apps. With React Native, you can make apps that feel completely native, but are written in JavaScript. That means you can leverage your skills as a web developer, while at the same time re-use pretty much all the code on several platforms. You could write a native app, in a compiled language like Objective-C, C# or Java. But compiling code takes time. With React Native, you don't have to build the app to see changes. This accelerates the feedback loop, and you'll be much more productive. In this talk, I'll introduce you to React Native and lessons learned from using it in production. ------------------------ In the ongoing war between the frameworks - there seem to be two that are head and shoulders above the rest. Is there really room for anything else or will all the upstarts be left bleeding in the dust even if they are objectively at least as good if not better then the major players? Well. This talk strikes a blow for Vue.js. It has survived its test of fire in regards to staying power. Its faster than the competition. It is easier to write, easier to read and does all the things the main combatants in the arena do (you can even write JSX if you like). In 2016, it got more stars on github than any other js-framework and is now up to 42.500 (comparable to Reacts 60K). That said. Will this talk change your mind to switch to Vue from React or Angular? Maybe not, but I will make a (strong) case for it anyway! We will have a look at what makes Vue unique but also (it is really hard not to) make a quick comparison to React since the two are really similar. ------------------------ We've had success with using atomic design principles when developing our react components. We did this using a tool called storybook which displays those components in isolation, meaning you can both use it to develop in it and also as a design showcase of your components. The whole thing is packaged as a npm package we can then import into any project we want. In this lightning talk I will go through how we broke our components into atoms and molecules, and how storybook made it easier for the developers to make the components based on the spec while automatically gaining a design showcase we can use a reference or show to others. ------------------------ So you finally made it into being an architect, but you find yourself becoming one of those dreaded PowerPoint architects. What can you do to avoid that? Simple: become an SVG architect! SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open format and part of HTML5. Therefore, nobody has an excuse to tell you they can't view your diagrams. But working with SVG is fun, not in the least because it's still a little bit technical. If you want to, you can actually dive into the XML source file and fix things there. But SVG offers you also a lot more possibilities than a traditional drawing tool will give you. There are e.g. open libraries on the Internet where you can find all sorts of shapes, icons and maps. But maybe most important: it's easy to create your own color palette and add your own style to a drawing, so that it doesn't look so \u201cPowerPointy\u201d.

That's the day that Magikcraft and Microsoft set the historic world record for \"The Most Minecraft Zombies Killed with JavaScript Lightning in 10 minutes\". To achieve the historic milestone of 13,854 Zombies killed in 10 minutes by 40 kids wielding JavaScript lightning, Magikcraft build the most performant Minecraft server and logging system on the planet. This is a tale of development, DevOps, of epic system optimizations, near tragedy, and the triumph of the human spirit. Just as NASA's space program technology rolled back into human society to change the quality of human life - the technology developed to set that world record has been used to make a difference in the quality of life of children and families living with Type 1 Diabetes. The MCT1 project, conceived through a chance meeting at NDC Sydney in 2016, uses this technology to fundamentally alter the quality of life for people around the world. As software developers, we hold a tremendous power and with it a great responsibility. In this talk you'll get a real sense of the power and the possibility of the connections around you and the abilities that you have. ------------------------------ \u201cOf course we can keep it a secret!\u201d, you say. \u201cChallenge accepted\u201d, says the hacker! There are more secrets to be kept than the login credentials of your users. User authentication is a problem you can solve this by using authentication providers or frameworks. It is easy to forget that we often handle other secrets as well. These may be just as critical, or even more so: What about cryptographic keys, signing keys, credentials to third party systems both for the system itself and/or mapped to each of your users? If these secrets ever get revealed, the damage to the reputation of your company, client or yourself could be enormous. Not to mention potentially having to compensate for damages as well. This talk discusses how one can securely store secrets using extremely secure cloud based storage solutions specialized for secrets. What are the use cases and how to integrate with your application. The topics covered are based on the research and experience gained during the implementation of my current project.

VCS can count everything: page popularity, click count, trending content, articles or sale products, where traffic is coming from, URLs with long load times, URLs with most hits, URLs with the most 50x response code errors, which clients are generating load, etc. VCS outputs data via a time series API in JSON format which can easily be integrated into existing monitoring solutions. Norwegian, M\u00f8ller Group is a good example of how using VCS\u2019s JSON output data in combination with a monitoring tool can create real business value. Before using VCS, the company experienced load problems in its main database but did not know where the usage was coming from. On the API side, often the cause of load, they couldn\u2019t visualise the data traffic.

That they are fundamentally different to previous generations. That they prefer to freelance, are addicted to technology and prefer sharing over owning. Personally, I believe that the trend we are witnessing is more related to the development of technology platforms and the opportunities that they bring, rather than labels we can place on a specific set of people. The technology part has received a fascinating small amount of focus when it really has been the driver of the sharing economy. The sharing economy is just a consequence of that we finally have the tools to find others than the big companies. It is the software platforms that are the really interesting stuff. The platforms create an infrastructure that allow for collaboration and interaction between end users. This is the infrastructure which allow you to share your car, your ride, apartment or your tools. These two-sided markets are also interesting from a network effect perspective, where it pays off to be an actor in a network with a lot of participants on the other side of the market. This is commonly seen in the sharing economy and can explain why some platforms achieve almost a monopoly status while still competing in the free market. If I have an apartment I want to rent out, I\u2019m more likely to put it out on AirBnb if it has a lot more users than similar platforms. Now - what effect will these platforms have on today's companies? The hotel and taxi business are surely in trouble, but what about everyone else? Going back to the fundamental article by Ronald Coase in 1937 - \u00abThe Nature of the Firm\u00bb - why do companies exist? Coase\u2019s hypothesis was that companies exist primarily because of the transaction costs of using a market. What the platforms and the sharing economy have done is to reduce the transaction cost dramatically. In fact, the costs have been reduced to a level where it might make more sense to have an economy of freelancers rather than employees.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily a either-or decision to make there, and I think it\u2019s worth doing some end-to-end tests before your code reaches the production infrastructure. In this talk I\u2019ll share my experiences handling end-to-end automated tests in a pre-production environment, and some techniques I\u2019ve found particularly useful. The first technique, is to make the tests talk the same protocols as the microservices. So the tests submit requests via REST, then listen to all the relevant traffic being sent between the services while the request is processed. The second technique I use is Approval Testing, which allows me to verify the correct messages are being passed, without test maintenance costs getting out of control. The third technique is not so much about the actual tests, but about how you configure your deployment pipeline so that the tests give the most useful feedback to development teams. This is all about resolving the conflict that arises when you want to keep services and teams working independently, while having tests that check they work together correctly.", "tags": ["Continuous Delivery", "Microservices", "Architecture", "Testing"], "workshop": false, "url": "http://ndcoslo.com/talk/end-to-end-automated-testing-in-a-microservices-architecture/", "title": "Talk: End-to-End Automated Testing in a Microservices Architecture", "preamble": "When you move from a monolithic architecture towards a distributed microservices setup, it makes some things easier, but other things become harder. Testing is one of those things that has a bit of both. Compared to a monolith, your tests probably have a lot more APIs they can access - each individual microservice can be tested in isolation, with the rest of the system mocked or stubbed. This can be really useful - you can have greater confidence that the parts of your system work by themselves - even quite large parts. In my experience, you don\u2019t get away from the need for end-to-end tests entirely though. There can still be integration errors between the services. If you can write tests that exercise your whole system while none of your own services are replaced by a test double, you can find some pretty important issues, before you deploy to production.", "level": "Advanced"}, "preamble": "Emily is an experienced software developer with a focus on the engineering practices which make agile methods work.

Today, in the age of connected devices and machine learning, we live in a world where humans ask questions and expect computers to have the answers.

We'll start by going right back to Roy Fielding's original thesis \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\", in which he describes the set of constraints that define this much-misunderstood architectural style. We'll explain the significance of each of these constraints, and give some examples of real-world systems that demonstrate each constraint in action. We'll compare and contrast the four main frameworks that exist for building HTTP APIs using C# and .NET - NancyFX, ServiceStack, OpenRasta, and Microsoft's own WebAPI. We'll discuss how the recent release of .NET Core opens up new possibilities for developing and hosting your APIs, from cross-platform IDEs like Rider and Visual Studio Code, to running .NET Core on Linux and using serverless hosting environments like AWS Lambda. We'll explore the various formats that exist for representing hypermedia resources in JSON - HAL, SIREN, HYDRA, JSON-LD and Collection+JSON, and the relative merits of each. We'll go beyond 200 OK and 404 Not Found and explore how you can use the full range of HTTP verbs, headers and response codes to build expressive, responsive APIs. We'll look at ways of securing your HTTP APIs, and techniques and patterns you can use to document and test your APIs in development, and monitor them when they're running in production. Finally, to put all this in context, we'll talk about why REST might not always be the best solution to your problem, look briefly at some of the alternative API patterns you may want to consider using, and finish up with some discussion of how RESTful services can fit into your organisation's technology strategy - and how to persuade your boss, and your team, that they're worth investing in. You'll leave the workshop with a comprehensive understanding of building HTTP APIs in C# and .NET, your own working implementations of the patterns and techniques we've talked about, and a much clearer idea of what REST is - and why so many people are still getting wrong, nearly twenty years after it was first defined. REST, HTTP, ASP.NET, WebAPI, NancyFX, ServiceStack, OpenRASTA. API design, hypermedia, HATEOAS, software architecture, cacheability. Attendees will need to bring a computer which can compile and run ASP.NET web applications.
