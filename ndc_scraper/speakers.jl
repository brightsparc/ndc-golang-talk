Although traditionally a .NET/C# dev, I thought I should make an attempt to learn something new. Go is cool and shiny, so I thought I'd combine my love of all things Azure with the new \"shiny shiny\". -------------------- Do you know that your favorite cafe is following Kanban possibly even without knowing about it. I'm going to explain how they manage their flow and keep work in progress limits in check using very simple yet effective methods. -------------------- Customers come in all shapes and sizes. Some will use your products exactly as you intend while others will go way beyond your expectations. This is perfectly normal, possibly the price of success, but it can result in all kinds of problems that you didn't expect. Problems can range from terrible performance to usability issues where the user interface becomes useless. It can be surprising when a dashboard that looks great for ten records can be completely unusable when it displays a thousand records. This can be far more frustrating than a page that is simply slow to load. Octopus Deploy, a friendly .NET deployment automation tool, has to contend with this problem. Some customers have a single project, and some have thousands. It's a challenge designing for everyone. This session is all about thinking about scale when building and designing the user interface of your apps and web sites. We\u2019ll review the lessons learned from growing Octopus Deploy and offer actionable tips that you can apply on the projects you're building right now. Techniques and patterns to display empty state, one thing, some things and too many things. This is still a work in progress so you'll see the good, the bad and the ugly. The goal of this presentation is to help you design your apps so they work great for all your customers. -------------------- Bots have grown in popularilty, but their utility to consumers is questionable. Where bots are extremely useful to are to technical teams. The tech team at Domain have written dozens of bots to automate and improve workflows around many, many of our internal tasks. We have started to look out our chat tools as a shared, transparent and pretty command line interface. In this talk I'll cover a range of examples and provide inspiration to go back to your work and start building some bots of your own. -------------------- Voice assistants have started to take over our lives in recent years, from Siri, Google and Cortana on mobile devices to Amazon Alexa in the centre of our homes. In this talk you will learn how to design great voice user interfaces that will make your voice assistants feel like a friend more than a robot to your users."}}

Workshop participants are set specific goals they must complete that involve probing for risks and then exploiting discrete vulnerabilities in a specially built vulnerable application. The interactive nature of the workshop means that multiple attack vectors are usually identified across the spectrum of participants and each person contributes their own unique perspective as to how specific risks are exploited. The objective of the workshop is that each person walks away with demonstrated experience across a broad spectrum of specific risks. They not only learn about but also demonstrate practical experience across a range of different vulnerabilities targeted to the specific needs of the group. Any software developer who wants to get a better understanding what is going on in cyber space if it comes to hacking and cracking of systems. This workshop enables you to take a pro-active approach and you learn how hackers will try to break your system. This workshop will be an eye opener for most developers and it is the starting point of becoming a better developer. It all starts with awareness and improving your own habits.

Topics will include: * How does your attitude to security change? * Is it easier, or harder, to create reliable, resilient systems? * Do patterns like Circuit breakers and connection pools make sense any more? * Is vendor lock-in a problem? * Is serverless computing only for microservice architectures? * Which problems fit serverless computing? By the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer, cut through some of the hype, and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations.

Introduce a code generator to generate the boilerplate. 5. Introduce a DSL to represent Product and Union Types and hook it up to the code generator. 6. Integrate the whole thing into Visual Studio to provide a seamless extension to allow using ADTs within existing C# projects. 7.

Well there are two big reasons: first of all: If people with an intellectual disability can use your app, they can get info about their life-situation and that empowers quality of life.

It\u2019s lightweight, it\u2019s free, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, and it\u2019s a little rambunctious. VS Code aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to its big brother. Being lighter doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not better. Most of the serious Angular 2 devs at SSW already choose VS Code as their weapon of choice. Watch as Adam Cogan gives you a tour of these great IDEs and expands your development horizons.
