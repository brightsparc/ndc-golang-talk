Won Ubergeek Award!
- ‚ÄúMost bleeding edge, technologically advanced and buzzword compliant innovation‚Äù

* Brief history of go

Created in 2007 by Google team including Rob Pike & Ken Thomspon.

1. Memory safe, with c-like performance
2. Developer productivity (really fast compilation, easy to grok)
3. Native concurrency

Version 1.0 in 2012
Current [[https://blog.golang.org/go1.8][1.8]] in Feb 2017
Version [[https://dave.cheney.net/2016/10/25/introducing-go-2-0][2.0]] offers option for new breaking changes.

* C# vs Go

Same:

- Statically Typed, Namespaces/packages
- Managed runtime, Good standard library
- Small Compiled binary

Different:

- Simple types limited to structs and interfaces (no generics)
- Multiple return values, with explicit error handling
- Native concurrency with goroutines
- Testing over Debugging with first class benchmarking & performance tools

Go Mantra: ‚ÄúLess is more‚Äù

* Code Examples

I will run through some example code

- IO
- JSON
- HTTP Server
- Concurrency
- CGO
- Testing
- Profiling

* Example Code: Hello World

All go programs define package and main.

.play ndc_examples/00_hello.go

* Example Code: IO

Simple file IO example.

.code ndc_examples/01_file.go

Multiple return values, explicit error handling, `defer` method.

* Example Code: JSON

Example file `Talk.json`

.code ndc_examples/talk.json

: Nested structure

* Example Code: JSON

Define a struct and json annotations.

.code ndc_examples/02_json.go

* Example Code: HTTP

Simple http server.

.code ndc_examples/03_http.go

Using inline function definition for handler.

* Example Code: Concurrency

Create, send and read from channel.

.code ndc_examples/04_channel.go

Make is used to create channels with an optional size.

* Example Code: Concurrency

Wait groups can be used block until goroutines complete.

.play ndc_examples/05_waitgroup.go

* Example Code: Concurrency

Sqaure function takes an input, channel, returns a new channel with results.

.play ndc_examples/06_fanout.go

: The close function ends the range loop

* Example Code: CGO

Go can interoperate with native C code.

.play ndc_examples/07_cgo.go

* Example Code: Testing

Testing and benchmarking

.code ndc_examples/08_test.go

: Provide some clarity on number of times functions execute

* Example Code: Testing results

Benchmarking will happen in sequence after succesful tests.

    go test -v -bench=. -cpuprofile cpu.out 08_test.go
    === RUN   TestSucceed
    --- PASS: TestSucceed (0.00s)
    	08_test.go:6: Do something useful
    BenchmarkFib10-4   	 3000000	       445 ns/op
    PASS
    ok  	command-line-arguments	2.955s

Output includes the number of # times method called, and timing per operation.

* Performance: Slowest calls

Use the go tool [[https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs][pprof]] to load profile for compiled code or test.

    go tool pprof main.test cpu.out
    Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
    (pprof) top5
    2.60s of 2.61s total (99.62%)
    Dropped 6 nodes (cum <= 0.01s)
    Showing top 5 nodes out of 12 (cum >= 2.56s)
          flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
         2.55s 97.70% 97.70%      2.55s 97.70%  command-line-arguments.Fib
         0.03s  1.15% 98.85%      0.03s  1.15%  runtime.usleep
         0.02s  0.77% 99.62%      0.02s  0.77%  runtime.duffcopy
             0     0% 99.62%      2.55s 97.70%  command-line-arguments.BenchmarkFib10
             0     0% 99.62%      2.56s 98.08%  runtime.goexit

CPU profiling samples 100 times per second, also supports MEM profiling.

* Performance: Lines of code

You can also inspect the total time within methods

    (pprof) list Fib
    Total: 2.61s
    ROUTINE ======================== command-line-arguments.Fib in 08_test.go
         2.55s      3.75s (flat, cum)   100% of Total
         640ms      640ms      9:func Fib(n int) int {
         400ms      400ms     10:	if n < 2 {
         160ms      160ms     11:		return n
             .          .     12:	}
         1.35s      2.55s     13:	return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
             .          .     14:}

* Development Environment & Tooling

No IDE; code with [[https://atom.io/][Atom]] and [[https://atom.io/packages/go-plus][go-plus]] which includes

- Autocomplete using `gocode`
- Format your code with `gofmt`, `goimports`, or `goreturns`; optionally run one on save
- Run a variety of linters (e.g. golint, vet, etc.) against your code using gometalinter
- Go to definition using guru or godef

Dependency management with [[https://github.com/kardianos/govendor][govendor]]

If you really need it, debugger support with [[https://github.com/derekparker/delve][Delve]]

* Deployment

Easy with docker

* Visualisation

It's possible to create some really interesting patterns, and even visualise them.
